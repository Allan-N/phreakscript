						<para>By default, the time spent prompting for deposits does not count against overtime credit.

						ACTS historically operated.</para>
						<para>This option will allow you to instead have prompts count against credit (which makes billable
						overtime exactly 60 minutes, as opposed to the default, which is closer to 80 seconds). It also
						allows callers more time to deposit during overtime, since this duration is being deducted
						from the call balance.</para>

						<para>Allow uninterrupted post-paid overtime, where the caller signals when through by hook flashing.</para>

						<para>During overtime, this will override the 'f' option, if present.</para>
